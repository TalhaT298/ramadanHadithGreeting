# Ramadan Mubarak Hadith Card Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates a random Hadith related to Ramadan and allows users to download the generated Hadith as an image. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the `html2canvas` library to capture the card as an image.

## Features

- **Random Hadith Generation**: The application randomly selects a Hadith from a predefined list and displays it in Arabic, English, and Bangla.
- **Reference Display**: Each Hadith comes with its reference from authentic sources like Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.
- **Download as Image**: Users can download the generated Hadith card as a high-quality PNG image.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Project**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

2. **Generate a Hadith**:
   - Type something in the input field and click the **"Get Hadith"** button to generate a random Hadith.

3. **Download the Card**:
   - Click the **"Download"** button to save the Hadith card as an image.

## Code Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file that styles the web page and the Hadith card.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for generating Hadiths and downloading the card.
